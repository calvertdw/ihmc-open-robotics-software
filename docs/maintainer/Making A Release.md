#### Preparing for release

1. Record the CI URLs for ihmc-open-robotics-software and record them the README.
   * There is a new  Status Icons plugin that gives an icon.
1. Pin the Atlas OCU to the global build number. Some tags (i.e. `build-3344`)will help here.
1. Clone only the repos needed to run Atlas. Should be around 5.
    * Make sure there are no other repos in your group.
