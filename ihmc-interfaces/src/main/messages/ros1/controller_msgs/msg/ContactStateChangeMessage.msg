# Flag to indicate whether this rigid body is making or breaking contact.
# If true, the controller will try to add a contact point at the given time. If the rigid body is already in contact, this request is ignored.
# Otherwise, the controller will add a contact point at the rigid body's lowest point in world frame as defined by its collision mesh.
# If false, the controller will remove all contact points associated with this rigid body.
